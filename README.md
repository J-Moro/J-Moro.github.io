# J-Moro.github.io

This is a website that contains my resume. Actually, it *is* my resume, in great detail.

I'm just getting started in web development, and I think that the best way to learn is to code. So, here it is: my first project and beginning of my journey.

## Getting Started

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can access it directly through [j-moro.github.io](https://j-moro.github.io).

There is a PDF version available for download in the homepage. My contact information is also there.
